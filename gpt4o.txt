# What is MARP?

MARP Guide
The Manual of Academic Regulations and Procedures (MARP) is a comprehensive document that outlines the academic regulations, policies, and procedures at Lancaster University. It is designed to assure the quality and standards of the university's awards and programmes, as well as to enhance the student academic experience. MARP applies to all categories of students, all academic programmes, and all types of awards, including undergraduate degrees, postgraduate taught degrees, and postgraduate research degrees. It encompasses regulations for both standard academic programmes and specific programmes that may have approved variations [1].

MARP is updated and published annually on September 1st, with the current version reflecting the regulations applicable to all registered students, including those in collaborative teaching partnerships [1], [1]. Changes to MARP are generally reviewed after one operational year to ensure relevance and effectiveness, and any amendments are approved by the Academic Standards and Quality Committee (ASQC) [1], [1].

The document serves as a crucial reference for students and staff to understand the academic framework within which the university operates [1].

# Why does Lancaster University have MARP?

MARP Guide
Lancaster University has the Manual of Academic Regulations and Procedures (MARP) to assure the quality and standards of the university’s awards and programmes, as well as to enhance the student academic experience. The MARP contains the university's academic regulations, policies, and procedures, which are designed to support these goals across all categories of students, academic programmes, and types of awards, including undergraduate degrees, postgraduate taught degrees, diplomas, certificates, and postgraduate research degrees [1], [1].

Additionally, MARP is informed by external regulations, codes of practice, and guidelines, ensuring compliance with principles of good practice, such as those outlined in the UK Quality Code for Higher Education [1]. This framework helps to maintain a high academic reputation and institutional quality standards, ultimately benefiting both students and the university [2], [1].

# What happens if I am ill during exams?

MARP Guide
If you are ill during exams, you may be able to claim "good cause" for your inability to attend or complete assessments. "Good cause" is defined as illness or other relevant personal circumstances that affect your performance in examinations or assessments [1].

To support your claim, you must provide appropriate evidence, which typically includes a report describing your medical condition or adverse personal circumstances. This report should be accompanied by a supporting statement from an appropriate person, such as a medical practitioner [1][1]. If the medical condition has lasted more than five days, the report must be completed by a qualified medical practitioner who can comment on how the condition likely affected your ability to prepare for or carry out the assessments [1].

It is your responsibility to notify your department of these circumstances and provide the necessary evidence. This notification should occur within forty-eight hours after the examination or the due date for coursework submission. Late notifications may not be accepted unless extenuating circumstances prevented you from notifying the department in time [1].

Additionally, each department has an exceptional circumstances committee that reviews claims of good cause and determines the appropriate action [1].

# How can I get a first class degree?

MARP Guide
To achieve a First Class Honours degree at Lancaster University, students must meet the following criteria:

Pass All Modules: Students must pass all modules without any condonation. Condonation refers to the practice of allowing a student to pass a module despite not achieving the required pass mark, which is typically 40% for undergraduate modules [1].

Overall Mean Aggregation Score: The overall mean aggregation score must be 70% or above. This score is calculated based on the marks obtained in all modules taken during the degree programme [1].

Specific Module Requirements: Certain key modules, such as the final year project or dissertation, may have additional requirements that must be satisfied without condonation. It is essential to verify the specific requirements for these modules as outlined in the programme regulations [1].

These criteria ensure that students demonstrate a high level of academic achievement across their degree programme.

# What is module condonation?

MARP Guide
Module condonation refers to the process by which a student may be allowed to pass a module despite not achieving the minimum passing mark, provided certain conditions are met. Specifically, within a master's degree programme, up to a maximum of 45 credits may be condoned if the mark after all opportunities for reassessment is at least 40% [1]. For postgraduate diplomas, the maximum is 30 credits, and for postgraduate certificates, it is 20 credits [1].

Condonation is subject to approval by the relevant faculty committee, which may also reduce the number of credits available for condonation to 30 [1]. Additionally, individual modules can be declared uncondonable if properly approved, and all such decisions must be communicated to students [1].

The phrase "should normally" indicates that condonation must be granted unless examiners provide a justified reason not to do so, which must be documented in the examination board minutes [1]. If a student receives a mark of zero for a module due to academic malpractice, this mark may ordinarily be condoned, provided it does not result in the student exceeding the permitted number of condoned credits [1].

# What is Lancaster's policy on plagiarism?


MARP Guide
Lancaster University's policy on plagiarism is detailed in the Academic Malpractice Regulations and Procedures. Plagiarism is defined as the act of copying or paraphrasing from a source without appropriate acknowledgment, which includes quoting directly from another source without using quotation marks. It also encompasses the submission of all or part of another student’s work, whether with or without that student’s knowledge or consent, and the commissioning or use of work that is not the student's own, presented as if it were their own [1][2][1].

The university considers several forms of plagiarism, including:

The submission of work purchased or obtained from a commercial service.
The inclusion of material derived through false authorship.
Reproducing the same or almost identical work that has previously been submitted for assessment, except in cases where students are permitted or required to develop previously assessed work into a larger argument for their dissertation or thesis.
Directly copying from model solutions or answers that have been made available [1][2][1].
Plagiarism is treated as a serious violation of academic integrity and can result in disciplinary actions, which may include exclusion from the university [1][2]. The regulations emphasize the importance of proper citation and acknowledgment of sources to maintain academic integrity [1][2].

# Can I retake a failed exam?

MARP Guide
Yes, you can retake a failed exam, but the specific conditions depend on your program of study.

For undergraduate programs, students who fail any module will have one opportunity for reassessment within the same academic year. If the mark for the module is below 40%, reassessment is compulsory; otherwise, it is optional [3].

In the context of the Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBChB) program, students must sit all assessment components, and if they fail any assessments after the resit examination period, they are granted the opportunity to repeat the entire year of study once. In this repeat year, students will need to resit all assessments as if for the first time, with no marks from the previous year carried forward [2][2].

It is important to note that reassessment opportunities may be prohibited for certain professional accreditation reasons, which would be clearly stated in the assessment guidelines provided to students [1].

# How many credits do I need to graduate?


MARP Guide
To graduate from an undergraduate programme at Lancaster University, a student must achieve the minimum credit requirement for their specific programme. Generally, this includes:

For a Certificate of Higher Education: A minimum of 80 credits with a mark of 9.0 or more at level 4 or above, and an additional 40 credits with a mark of 7.0 or more at level 4 or above [1].

For a Diploma of Higher Education: A minimum of 240 credits, with at least 90 credits at level 5 [1].

For a Bachelor's Degree: A minimum of 360 credits, with at least 90 credits at level 6 [1].

For an Integrated Master's Degree: Students must attain the full minimum credit requirement for the programme, which typically includes passing all contributory modules [3].

Additionally, it is important to note that credits for failed modules may be condoned under certain conditions, but students must still meet the overall aggregation score requirements to qualify for graduation [2].

# Tell me about grades

MARP Guide
Grades at Lancaster University are determined based on a percentage marking scale, which is detailed in the postgraduate taught assessment regulations. Each piece of assessed work is graded according to specific criteria, with the following key points regarding the grading system:

Grading Scale: The grading system uses a percentage scale, with grades assigned based on the average marks of assessments. For example, the upper second class is represented by grades B+, B, and B- corresponding to 17, 16, and 15 points respectively [1].

Pass Marks: A minimum mark of 40% is generally required to pass a module. Marks below this threshold are considered uncondonable, meaning they cannot be compensated by higher marks in other assessments [1][1].

Aggregation of Marks: To establish a final result for a module, the mean of the relevant percentage marks from component assessments is computed, taking into account any specified weights. This average is calculated to one decimal place [1].

Academic Judgement: The final grades awarded are based on academic judgement, which is subject to moderation and confirmed through exam boards. This judgement cannot be disputed by students, nor can it form the basis for an academic appeal [1].

Double Marking: For assessments that involve double marking or second marking, there are clear procedures to resolve any disagreements between markers regarding final marks and grades [1].

Feedback and Calibration: Departments are encouraged to use calibration exercises among markers to ensure consistency in grading. Feedback on assessment tasks is also included for review by moderators and external examiners [1][1].

In summary, grades are assigned based on a structured percentage system, with specific criteria for passing and processes in place for ensuring fairness and consistency in marking.

# What if I fail?

MARP Guide
If you fail a module or assessment at Lancaster University, the following procedures and regulations apply:

Resit Opportunities: Students may be allowed to resit assessments. A resit is an opportunity to attain a passing grade through reassessment processes [1].

Condonement: If a resit mark falls within the condonable range and meets the criteria for condonation, it may be considered for passing the module [1]. However, if condonation would lead to exceeding the maximum number of condoned credits, the mark will remain uncondoned, and the board of examiners will address the student's situation accordingly [3].

Good Cause: If a student has failed due to exceptional circumstances, they may claim "good cause." This encompasses situations such as illness or personal circumstances that adversely affect performance. Claims must be properly evidenced and approved [3][4]. If good cause is established, it may affect the assessment of the work submitted or the decision regarding attendance at examinations [2][4].

Reassessment Timing: In some cases, if a student fails a coursework element, they may be permitted to take a further assessment during the summer, which will be treated as the first attempt if the original coursework was failed [4].

Assessment of Claims: When assessing claims of good cause, the evidence provided will be scrutinized, and fairness to both the individual student and other students will be considered [4]. If a student's work is found to be manifestly prejudiced by good cause, it may be deemed as not submitted [4].

In summary, if you fail, you may have the opportunity to resit assessments or claim good cause, which could influence the outcome of your assessment. It is essential to understand the specific regulations that apply to your situation and to seek guidance from academic advisors if needed.

# Waht is extneuting circmstances?

MARP Guide
Exceptional circumstances refer to events or actions outside the control of a student that significantly impact their academic performance. These circumstances may lead to a student failing to complete required assessments by stipulated deadlines or result in their assessed work being of a lesser standard than would typically be expected based on their overall performance during their studies [1][3].

The university has established exceptional circumstances committees to review claims of good cause, which may include illness or personal issues affecting a student’s ability to attend examinations or submit coursework on time [4][3]. Such claims must be supported by appropriate evidence, which is scrutinized by the committee to ensure fairness to both the individual student and the integrity of the assessment process as a whole [3][3].

In cases where students are unable to attend formal examinations, they must notify the university within 48 hours of the scheduled examination start time, providing written evidence of their circumstances [3]. If circumstances are deemed valid, the committee can propose remedies to the examination board [1][2].

# What are the requirements for undergraduate assessment?


MARP Guide
Undergraduate assessment at Lancaster University is governed by several key regulations, which outline the requirements for assessment and progression. Here are the main points:

Pass Mark: The standard pass mark for undergraduate honours degrees and other undergraduate awards is set at 9.0. A student is awarded credit for a module when they achieve an overall mark of 9.0 or greater, or if the module has been condoned [1].

Progression Requirements: For specific programmes, such as the BA (Hons) Architecture, students must pass all modules and subcomponents of assessment at a minimum pass mark of 9.0 to progress from year 2 to year 3. Notably, condonation of modules is not available for this programme [2].

Assessment Types: Departments are required to ensure that a significant proportion of assessments are individual assessments, meaning they must be demonstrably the student’s own work. Various assessment types that satisfy this criterion include controlled examination environments, presentations, in-class tests, and observed laboratory sessions [1][1].

Feedback and Provisional Marks: Students will receive feedback that typically includes the grade outcomes of summative assessments. It is important to note that all marks are provisional until confirmed or amended by the relevant examining bodies [1].

Distribution of Learning and Assessment Activities: Learning and assessment activities should be evenly distributed across academic sessions, typically involving four modules (equivalent to 120 credits) in both the second and third years [1].

Overall Assessment Scheme: Students will have access to information regarding the overall assessment scheme for their award, including the regulations for degree classification where applicable [1].

These regulations ensure that assessments are fair, transparent, and conducive to students’ learning and progression throughout their academic journey.

# What are the submission deadlines for assignments?

MARP Guide
Submission deadlines for assignments are governed by several regulations:

For undergraduate programmes, the last possible date for submission of part II coursework for any module must be no later than the end of the third week of the summer term [1].

In exceptional cases, where special approval has been granted at the time of programme approval, second-year dissertations and projects may be submitted by the end of the first week of the following Michaelmas term. If such work is awarded a fail mark, students may re-submit it once, but this must be done by no later than the end of the first week of the Lent term [1].

For the written component of certain projects, specifically those mentioned in GR 2.3.4, the submission deadline is set for week 27 [1].

It is important to note that submission and examination deadlines must be clearly published for all summative assessments and provided to students at the commencement of each module [1].

Additionally, for postgraduate assessments, work submitted up to three days late without an agreed extension will incur a penalty of 10 percentage points [1].

These regulations ensure that students are aware of their submission deadlines and the consequences of late submissions.

# What is academic misconduct?

MARP Guide
Academic misconduct, referred to as academic malpractice, is defined as any act designed to obtain an unfair advantage for oneself or others in an academic context. This includes various forms of dishonest behavior that violate the principles of academic integrity, which the university values highly. The university expects all members, including staff and students, to uphold these core values of honesty and mutual trust in their academic endeavors [1][1].

Specific instances of academic misconduct may include, but are not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, fabrication of data, and any other actions that compromise the integrity of academic work. The university has established regulations and procedures to address allegations of academic malpractice, ensuring that all cases are considered fairly and justly [1][1].

Students are encouraged to engage with university resources that inform and educate them about what constitutes academic malpractice and the potential consequences of such actions [1][1].

# What happens if I miss an exam?

MARP Guide
If you miss an exam, the regulations regarding your situation depend on whether you can provide evidence of good cause for your absence. If good cause is established, you will typically be expected to complete your assessment by either attending a special sitting of the examination or submitting outstanding work for assessment, if such an opportunity arises within your period of study [1][1]. This subsequent sitting or submission will be considered your first attempt if the missed exam was your first attempt [1].

If it is determined that the evidence does not support your claim of good cause, you will receive a percentage score of zero for the assessment or assessments in question [1]. In cases where you submitted work but claimed it was affected by good cause, and your evidence is not supported, your work will be assessed as though no claim had been made, and your grade for the module will be calculated accordingly [1].

Additionally, if you have completed 75% or more of the total work required for program assessment, the examining bodies may recommend an award or other outcome based on the work you completed [2]. If you completed at least 30% but less than 75%, an aegrotat (unclassified honours) degree may be recommended if the completed portion is of honours standard [2]. If less than 30% of the work is completed, you will be regarded as not having completed sufficient assessment to be awarded a degree [2].

# How is my degree classification calculated?

MARP Guide
Degree classification at Lancaster University is determined through a systematic process involving the assessment of student performance across modules and the application of specific classification criteria. The following outlines the key elements involved in calculating degree classifications:

Assessment of Marks: The marks obtained by students in their assessments are compiled and considered by boards of examiners. These boards evaluate the results of examinations and final marks, making recommendations to the committee of senate regarding the award of degrees and classifications [1].

Classification Scheme: For undergraduate degrees, classifications are typically based on the aggregation of marks across all modules. The classifications are as follows:

First Class: Typically awarded to students achieving an overall mean aggregation score of 70% or above.
Upper Second Class (2:1): Awarded to students with an overall mean aggregation score between 60% and 69%.
Lower Second Class (2:2): Awarded to students with an overall mean aggregation score between 50% and 59%.
Third Class: Awarded to students with an overall mean aggregation score between 40% and 49% [1].
Decile Classification for Specific Programs: For certain programs, such as the Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBChB), degree classifications are determined by ranking students' scores into deciles. The classifications based on deciles are:

Deciles 1 and 2: First Class
Deciles 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7: Upper Second Class
Deciles 8 and 9: Lower Second Class
Decile 10: Third Class [1][1].
Ratification Process: All degree classifications are subject to ratification by the committee of senate and are regarded as provisional until this ratification occurs. Students may receive provisional results immediately after the examination board meetings, but official results are sent within forty days of ratification [1][2].

Consideration of Non-Final Year Modules: Examination boards also take into account the marks derived from all non-final year modules taken and examined in the academic year under consideration, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of student performance [1][1].

This structured approach ensures that degree classifications are fair, transparent, and reflective of students' academic achievements throughout their studies.
