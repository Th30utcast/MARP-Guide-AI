The ultimate\nauthority for the regulation of assessment practice rests with the Senate, which, in turn,\nmay delegate operational authority to other constituent parts of the University or those\ninstitutions with which it enters into agreements.\nGR 1.1.2 Assessment regulations are defined as the collective rules governing the structures and\nprocesses under which assessment is undertaken and managed within the University,\nwhile assessment content is defined as the pieces of work assigned as both formative\nand summative assessment, including, but not limited to: essays, examinations, oral\npresentations, practical assessments, performance, portfolios of work, poster\npresentations, etc.\nResearch programmes\nGR 1.1.3 Within postgraduate research awards, assessment is the means whereby students\ndemonstrate scholarly research in a chosen field of study that makes an original\ncontribution to knowledge of a standard appropriate for scholarly publication. The\nultimate authority for the regulation of assessment practice rests with the Senate,\nwhich, in turn, may delegate operational authority to other constituent parts of the\nUniversity or those institutions with which it enters into agreements.\nGR 1.1.4 PhDs will involve, although not necessarily be limited to, the production of a thesis – a\ncoherent body of work, albeit potentially in a number of formats. Additional learning,\neither formative or summative, is seen as critical to success, particularly for individual’s\ncareer progression, but there is flexibility in both mode of delivery and required\noutcomes. The primary means of assessment are the thesis (or alternative body of work\n– see Appendix 3 of the Postgraduate Research Regulations) itself and an oral\nexamination which is objective, independent and which demonstrates an appropriate\nlevel of externality.\nGR 1.2 PRINCIPLES AND CONDITIONS\nGR 1.2.1 The University’s Education Framework summarises summarise the values upholding\nlearning, teaching and assessment for all undergraduate and postgraduate full-time and\npart-time degree programmes at Lancaster University. These principles and the\nregulations contained in this Manual are informed by the QAA Quality Code for Higher\nEducation and the Frameworks for HE Qualifications of UK Degree-Awarding Bodies and\nare designed to ensure that assessment:\nVersion 1.0 2"}

All such revisions will\nadhere to the University’s procedures for the approval of proposed revisions to existing\nprogrammes and modules, including appropriate consultation with students, as detailed\nin the Course Design, Development and Approval chapter of MARP.\nGR 1.2.5 Exceptionally, when on an occasion some provisions of these regulations have not been\nfollowed, the assessment results will remain valid provided that the Academic Registrar\nor nominee or other appropriately delegated officer acting on behalf of the Senate, in\nconsultation with appropriate colleagues, are satisfied that the assessment has been\nconducted substantially in accordance with the regulations.\nGR 1.2.6 Appropriate provision will be made for students with a formally recognised disability or\ntemporary impairment as detailed below and in accordance with the Lancaster\nUniversity Disabled Student Policy and the legal duties of the University under the\nEquality Act 2010.\nGR 1.2.7 The Equality Act 2010 defines ‘disability’ as a physical or mental impairment that has a\n‘substantial’ and ‘long-term’ negative effect on the ability to carry out normal, day-to-\nday activities. ‘Substantial’ is defined as more than minor or trivial and beyond the\nnormal differences in ability which exist amongst the general population. ‘Long-term’\nmeans 12 months or more.

Reasonable adjustments to genuine\ncompetence standards are not required but adjustments to the ways that competence standards are assessed\nare required so that disabled students are not disadvantaged in demonstrating their competence by the\nassessment method. If an adjustment cannot be made without compromising the competence standard itself,\nthe decision-making process and outcome should be clearly documented and communicated to the student\nand relevant staff including academic staff, Student and Programme Administration, Disability Service and\nAdmissions (where relevant).\nVersion 1.0 4"}

That feedback will normally include the grade outcomes of\nsummative assessment. All marks are provisional until they are confirmed or amended\nby the relevant examining bodies.\nGR 2.1.5 Heads of Department, or equivalent, will appoint at least one Assessment Officer per\ndepartment with the following delegated responsibilities:\n(a) to ensure, in conjunction with the programme Director of Studies or equivalent,\nthat the relevant course documentation accurately describes the assessment\nscheme and corresponding procedures;\n(b) to oversee the preparation of the relevant forms of assessment under secure\nconditions and ensure compliance with Senate's requirements in respect of\npreparing examination papers;\n(c) to ensure that External Examiner(s) are provided with the learning outcomes of\nthe programme and constituent modules, the intentions of the forms of\nassessment and the appropriate grading or classification scheme in use; and are\nsupplied with marking schemes or other guides where these are employed;\n(d) to ensure that all marks are collated and that no work is missed and that all\nmarks are recorded accurately and in the required format;\n(e) to convey provisional results and other information pertaining to the course, the\nassessment and the students to the External Examiner(s) and to the examining\nbodies in the required format;\n(f) to convey the results authenticated by the examining bodies to Student and\nProgramme Administration or equivalent in an agreed format.\nWhere it is deemed necessary, and at the discretion of the Head of Department or\nequivalent, more than one Assessment Officer will be appointed. Where this is done\nthere will be clear information provided to all interested parties as to which Officer is\nresponsible for which elements of assessment.\n2 Assessment types which typically satisfy this criterion include, but are not limited, to the following examples:\ncontrolled examination environments, presentations, in-class tests, observed laboratory\nsessions/performances/demonstrations, oral tests, observed tutorials or dissertations (where these involve\nattendance at supervision meetings and progress discussions on iterative draft assignments).

Production of assessment guidelines is delegated to appropriate\nbodies (academic departments or equivalent, Student and Programme Administration,\nDisability Service etc.). Guidelines will include: submission arrangements (for example\nmeans of recording performance, presentation format for group work, provision of\nreceipt, requirement for student to retain copies, use of cover sheet), submission\ndeadlines, submission format (electronic and/or hard copy), referencing requirements,\nmarking criteria, plagiarism processes, examination arrangements (including alternative\narrangements for disabled students), reassessment arrangements, etc.\nDefinition of Examination\nGR 2.2.2 A formal assessment undertaken in timed and controlled conditions. ‘Controlled’ means\nthat it is invigilated or proctored, that examinees undertake the assessment\nindependently and in silence or working with other students in a specified manner (for\nexample, in pairs for laboratory-based examinations). External aids are prohibited unless\nspecifically exempted (e.g. calculators or reference texts) or for pre-approved\nreasonable adjustments (e.g. disability-related arrangements or dual language\ndictionaries). Examinations may take place in-person or online. ‘Class test’ is not a\nformal category of assessment distinct from examination provided it conforms to the\ndefinition above.\nDeclaration of own work\nGR 2.2.3 Students shall be required to declare, in respect of every piece of submitted coursework\n(including dissertations and theses), that the submitted work is their own and has not\nbeen submitted in substantially the same form towards the award of a degree or other\nqualificatory work by the candidate or any other person, and affirming that\nacknowledgement has been made to assistance given and that all major sources have\nbeen appropriately referenced.

Guidance on the use of calibration can be found in the\nCurriculum and Education Development Academy’s webpages.

The use of calibration is encouraged\nwherever there is more than one marker for any assessment/module.\nIn addition, a representative sample of feedback on assessment tasks shall be included\nin the pack of papers provided to the moderator/external examiner, for their review as\npart of the moderation process.\nGR 2.4.3 For any assessed work where double marking or second marking is used, departments\nmust follow a clear procedure for determining final marks and grades where the two\nmarkers are in disagreement, and there must be a clear audit trail to show how the final\nmark or grade was reached. For small disagreements, taking a simple average may be\nappropriate, but where the difference is significant (e.g. a difference of 10 percentage\npoints or a full grade or more), and where the two markers remain unable to reconcile\ntheir differences even after discussion, an appropriate procedure is for the programme\ndirector or other appropriate person to ask a third internal marker to adjudicate.\nGR 2.4.4 Students will be advised about assessments that will be anonymously marked, whereby\nthe identity of students is masked from markers.\nGR 2.4.5 Where anonymous assessment is implemented, anonymity should normally be\nmaintained until the marking process is complete.\nGR 2.4.6 Where a student breaches their own anonymity, for example, by writing their name\nvisibly on an assessment, the student forfeits their right to anonymity.\nGR 2.4.7 Anonymity is the general expectation when the marking of students’ work is moderated.\nGR 2.4.8 Account must be taken of appropriate adjustments to marking of work completed by\ndisabled students, as defined with an ILSP and assessment cover sheet (where\napplicable).

For the final year (Level 7) of the Integrated Masters, reference should be\nmade to the primary level descriptors for intended learning outcomes as set out in\nAppendix 1 of the Postgraduate Taught Assessment Regulations. As well as the\nsubsidiary information, departments are encouraged to amplify the primary level\ndescriptors with more detailed secondary level descriptors specific to a particular field\nor level of study. For the purposes of classification, these grades will then be converted\ninto aggregation scores with reference to the conversion scheme in Appendix 1.\nGR 2.4.11 Where the outcome of the chosen mode of assessment can be demonstrated to be\nwholly quantitative, i.e. comprised of elements which collectively can be demonstrated\nto be sufficiently granular so as to be accurately graded against a one hundred percent\noutcome, percentile assessment is permissible. Percentage marks will then be\nconverted into a final aggregation score by reference to the conversion scheme in\nAppendix 2 of the Undergraduate Assessment Regulations. For modules which are\nassessed by wholly quantitative assessments, the module mean as a percentage will\ninitially be determined and this then converted to a module aggregation score.\nGR 2.4.12 For qualitative assessment where a piece of work merits a pass grade, markers should\ninitially assign the grade in the middle of the appropriate class to a piece of work and\nthen deliberately revise up or down if felt appropriate. For example, the upper second\nclass is covered by grades B+, B and B– (17, 16 and 15 points respectively). If a piece of\nwork is judged to match the intended learning outcomes of an upper second then the\ndefault should be to award the work a B grade and then only consider changing to either\nB+ or B– if the work shows particular strengths (B+) or weaknesses (B–).\nGR 2.4.13 Student work in the final year (Level 7) of the Integrated Masters will be marked using\nthe percentage marking scale set out in Appendix 1 of the Postgraduate Taught\nAssessment Regulations.

Where appropriate\nthe computation will employ weights as specified in the course documentation. The\noverall aggregation score for the module will be used for the purposes of calculating the\nfinal overall mean and hence degree classification.\nGR 2.4.17 Academic judgements on all forms of assessment (examination, practical/ professional\ncompetency, written submission, etc.), subject to the moderation arrangements\ndescribed above and confirmed through examining bodies or equivalent, are final and\ncannot be disputed by students. Nor can academic judgement form the basis of an\nacademic appeal or student complaint. Procedures for academic appeals are described\nin the chapter on Academic Appeals.\nGR 2.4.18 For the degree transcript and Higher Education Achievement Record (HEAR) individual\nmodule results will be expressed as aggregation scores and degree classes. Where a\nmark has been changed owing to either penalty or reassessment this change will also be\nindicated.
